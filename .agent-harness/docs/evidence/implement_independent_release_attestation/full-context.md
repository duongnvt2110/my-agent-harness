title: Require independent prior-release validation for harness release
generated_at: 2026-07-11 17:35:27 +0700
source_plan: /Users/exe-macbook/duong/ai/harness-scratch-template/.agent-harness/docs/exec-plans/active/current.md
source_context_pack: docs/evidence/implement_independent_release_attestation/context-pack.md

## Problem Statement

The candidate harness currently runs its own release fixtures and package
checks but can therefore become the sole authority that verifies and packages
its own control-plane changes.

## Goal

Require every harness release candidate to be independently exercised by a
trusted prior release or protected external validator before release
activation, while preserving explicit assurance limitations and package
identity evidence.

## Relevant ADRs

- id: ADR-0001 | path: docs/decisions/0001-define-scratch-harness-lifecycle-terminology.md | status: Accepted | reason: Defines the canonical lifecycle terms for the scratch harness.
- id: ADR-0002 | path: docs/decisions/0002-remove-harness-skill-selection-contract.md | status: Accepted | reason: Removes the live skill-selection contract from the harness.
- id: ADR-0003 | path: docs/decisions/0003-brownfield-agent-ready-execution-harness.md | status: Accepted | reason: Adds repo memory, ADR control, context packs, and structured task evidence.

## Constraints

- The full-context artifact must be generated before epic, story, or task decomposition.
- The artifact must remain task-scoped and repo-grounded.
- The harness should not require the user to hand-author the context layer.
- Existing task lifecycle commands remain the source of truth.

## Risks

- Repo state may change after the artifact is generated.
- Selected context may omit a newly relevant file if the pack is stale.
- A missing full-context file would cause breakdown commands to block.

## Unknowns

- Whether future tasks should store a canonical copy outside task evidence.
- How much of the generated context should be reused across follow-on tasks.
- Whether some breakdowns should require explicit human review before create.

## Assumptions

- The active plan and repository intelligence are sufficient to ground the breakdown.
- The selected docs and ADRs reflect the current implementation constraints.
- The full-context layer is a generation step, not a new lifecycle phase.

## Implementation Boundaries

- Add the full-context generator and validator.
- Wire the harness packet and task breakdown commands to require the artifact.
- Update workflow and context docs to name the new layer.
- Avoid broad task-store or lifecycle redesign.

## Recommended Breakdown

- Add a full-context generator command.
- Add a full-context validation command.
- Wire epic, story, and task creation to require the artifact.
- Update packet output and workflow docs.
- Add tests for generation and gating.

## Validation Notes

- Generated from the active plan, repository intelligence, and task-local context pack.
- Validate the artifact before allowing any epic, story, or task breakdown.
- This file is the pre-breakdown context source for the current task.
