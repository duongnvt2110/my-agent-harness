## Problem Statement

Rollback and materially new execution attempts currently create unlinked run
records, weakening auditability and successor authority isolation.

## Goal

Extend `run-events create` with an optional predecessor run identity. A
successor run records `supersedes_run_id`, predecessor task/spec/policy hashes,
and a lineage hash; the record is immutable and event verification reports the
lineage. Existing calls without a predecessor retain their behavior.

## Relevant ADRs

- id: ADR-0001 | path: docs/decisions/0001-define-scratch-harness-lifecycle-terminology.md | status: Accepted | reason: Defines the canonical lifecycle terms for the scratch harness.
- id: ADR-0002 | path: docs/decisions/0002-remove-harness-skill-selection-contract.md | status: Accepted | reason: Removes the live skill-selection contract from the harness.
- id: ADR-0003 | path: docs/decisions/0003-brownfield-agent-ready-execution-harness.md | status: Accepted | reason: Adds repo memory, ADR control, context packs, and structured task evidence.

## Constraints

- The full-context artifact must be generated before epic, story, or task decomposition.
- The artifact must remain task-scoped and repo-grounded.
- The harness should not require the user to hand-author the context layer.
- Existing task lifecycle commands remain the source of truth.

## Risks

- Repo state may change after the artifact is generated.
- Selected context may omit a newly relevant file if the pack is stale.
- A missing full-context file would cause breakdown commands to block.

## Unknowns

- Whether future tasks should store a canonical copy outside task evidence.
- How much of the generated context should be reused across follow-on tasks.
- Whether some breakdowns should require explicit human review before create.

## Assumptions

- The active plan and repository intelligence are sufficient to ground the breakdown.
- The selected docs and ADRs reflect the current implementation constraints.
- The full-context layer is a generation step, not a new lifecycle phase.

## Implementation Boundaries

- Add the full-context generator and validator.
- Wire the harness packet and task breakdown commands to require the artifact.
- Update workflow and context docs to name the new layer.
- Avoid broad task-store or lifecycle redesign.

## Recommended Breakdown

### Epic 1: auditable successor runs

Dependencies:

- Existing run identity and event-chain format

Acceptance Criteria:

- Successor authority is linked but never inherited

Stories:

- Immutable run lineage

Tasks:

- Implement predecessor validation, lineage hash, and tests

Replace the placeholders above with concrete epics, stories, tasks,
dependencies, and acceptance criteria before approval.

## Validation Notes

- Generated from the active plan, repository intelligence, and task-local context pack.
- Validate the artifact before allowing any epic, story, or task breakdown.
- This file is the pre-breakdown context source for the current task.
