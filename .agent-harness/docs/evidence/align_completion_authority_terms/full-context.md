## Problem Statement

The authority hierarchy still uses the obsolete `Completion judge` wording.

## Goal

Align the authority hierarchy with the approved `Completion Gate` terminology.

## Current Repo State

- active_plan: /Users/exe-macbook/duong/ai/harness-scratch-template/.agent-harness/docs/exec-plans/active/current.md
- repo_mode: brownfield
- task_change_type: extend_existing
- task_touches_existing_behavior: true
- task_backward_compatibility_required: true
- baseline_ref: null
- approved_scopes: harness_core, harness_docs, app_tests
- context_pack: docs/evidence/align_completion_authority_terms/context-pack.md

## Relevant ADRs

- id: ADR-0004 | path: docs/decisions/0004-agent-harness-vnext-authority-model.md | status: Accepted | reason: Terminology cleanup preserves completion authority

## Constraints

- The full-context artifact must be generated before epic, story, or task decomposition.
- The artifact must remain task-scoped and repo-grounded.
- The harness should not require the user to hand-author the context layer.
- Existing task lifecycle commands remain the source of truth.

## Risks

- Repo state may change after the artifact is generated.
- Selected context may omit a newly relevant file if the pack is stale.
- A missing full-context file would cause breakdown commands to block.

## Unknowns

- Whether future tasks should store a canonical copy outside task evidence.
- How much of the generated context should be reused across follow-on tasks.
- Whether some breakdowns should require explicit human review before create.

## Assumptions

- The active plan and repository intelligence are sufficient to ground the breakdown.
- The selected docs and ADRs reflect the current implementation constraints.
- The full-context layer is a generation step, not a new lifecycle phase.

## Implementation Boundaries

- Add the full-context generator and validator.
- Wire the harness packet and task breakdown commands to require the artifact.
- Update workflow and context docs to name the new layer.
- Avoid broad task-store or lifecycle redesign.

## Recommended Breakdown

### Epic 1: Align completion terminology

Dependencies:

- Existing Completion Gate definition.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Authority hierarchy and completion section use the same term.

Stories:

- Remove the obsolete terminology without changing the model.

Tasks:

- Edit and verify the approved TOC.

## Validation Notes

- Generated from the active plan, repository intelligence, and task-local context pack.
- Validate the artifact before allowing any epic, story, or task breakdown.
- This file is the pre-breakdown context source for the current task.
